   <head><p>It's cold where I'm at right now. It's only going to get colder. But that's okay because I love soup! Even during the summer I love eating 
    pho, ramen, you name it. Soup is just very good. It's always Hot Pot season where I'm at baby. 
    Anyway here's 3 Asian soup recipes from 3 respective chefs, each of their dishes respective origin. I hope you give them a go!</p></head>
