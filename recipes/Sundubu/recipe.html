    <img src="sundubu.jpg">
    <p>Sundubu Jjigae is a versatile and staple soup in Korea. This particular recipe comes from anouther popular youtuber,<a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/sundubu-jjigae">Maangchi!</a>
    I love this soup because not only is it bubbling hot, but the chili base is a must for people that enjoy spicier foods. This womans entire channel I came across reading a particularly
sad story, however it yielded in a very bittersweet ending and a wonderful channel I can't stop coming back for. Soup is such a comfort food, and this one takes a very high tier.
